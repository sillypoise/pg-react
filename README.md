# React Playground

A personal playground to play with all things React. That includes:

- Learning React primitives
- Learning React patterns
- Learning React libraries
- Other React related stuff

It's a messy repo and it's meant to serve as a personal scratchpad for learning. Feel free to clone, edit, contribute or whatever you want to do.

It's main purpose is to exist as a consequence free playground for practice and learning.

## Setup

It's setup as a monorepo using pnpm because I don't like having a million different repos. There is a main project at root which you can simply use as a template for new projects.

Each project is running a regular Vite + TypeScript template. All projects are client-side React.

If you want to create a new project just add it in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, check out the packages installed at root and install whatever packages you find necessary in your project directory.

Go play, have fun and learn.
